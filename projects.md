## [A Study of Transfer Learning in Music Source Separation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.12650)
#### June 2020 - October 2020
I studied the effect of transfer learning on music source separation on domains with small amounts of data, circumventing the need to have massive labeled datasets for a target domain. 

## [`nussl`: Northewestern University Source Separation Library](https://github.com/nussl/nussl)
#### March 2020 - Present
`nussl` is a python package for quick and easy implementation of audio source separation. I specifically contributed utilities for data augmentation and inferfacing with datasets. 

## [NylonRNN](../NylonRNN)
#### November 2019 - December 2019
A deep learning system to generate segments of classical guitar pieces. The final project for COMP_SCI 397 Computational Creativity.
