title: About me
---

I'm Andreas Bugler an undergraduate student at Northwestern University. I'm interested primarily machine learning, computer audition, and quantitative trading. I do research in audio source separation in the [Interactive Audio Lab](https://interactiveaudiolab.github.io) under the supervision of Prof. Bryan Pardo, [Ethan Manilow](https://ethman.github.io), and [Dr. Prem Seetharaman](https://pseeth.github.io).

I will be working software engineering internships at [Belvedere Trading](belvederetrading.com) during Winter 2021, and [Chicago Trading Company](https://www.chicagotrading.com) during Summer 2021.

In my free time, I'm either playing guitar, cooking new dishes, or pretending to be a tourist in Chicago.
